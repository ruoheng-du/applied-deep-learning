# Applied Deep Learning | Fall 2024
This repository contains the deep learning model implementations done in Applied Deep Learning course during Fall 2024. The course emphasizes building, training, and fine-tuning deep learning models to address real-world challenges across various domains. The goal of the course is to have hands-on experience with deep learning architectures like CNNs, RNNs, GPT, and BERT, and understand advanced concepts such as attention mechanisms, LoRA, and language modeling. The repository includes the following notebooks:

1. **XOR_MLP.ipynb**  
   Building an MLP to solve the XOR problem, demonstrating the power of non-linear activation functions in deep learning.
