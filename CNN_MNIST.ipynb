        "For this problem, you will code a basic digit recognition network. The data are images which specify the digits 1 to 10 as (1, 28, 28) data - this data is black and white images. Each pixed of the image is an intensity between 0 and 255, and together the (1, 28, 28) pixel image can be visualized as a picture of a digit. The data is given to you as $\\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where $y$ is the given label and x is the (1, 28, 28) data. This data will be gotten from `torchvision`, a repository of computer vision data and models.\n",
